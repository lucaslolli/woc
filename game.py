    Your eyes open to a dim, flickering light.
    You lie on your back, warm stone pressing against you.
    A headache pulses as the distant hum of machinery slowlly fills your mind.
    Memories feel scattered, like broken lines of code.
    As your vision sharpens, you see iron bars surrounding you, etched with pulsing runes.

    What is this place? Why am I here?
