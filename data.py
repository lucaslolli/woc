        The air is stifling and thick in this oppressive quarantine,
        heavy with the heat radiating from the glowing runes etched into the stone walls.
        Sweat beads on your skin as the temperature makes every breath feel like a struggle.
        A suffocating silence is occasionally broken by the crackle of energy shields
        and the low hum of distant overheating machinery.

        This is Firewall Quarantine, a crucible designed not just to contain threats,
        but to break them, serving as a reminder of the harsh penalties for contamination in this realm.

        Inside the confines of a cell, you take in your surroundings.
        The room is small, with iron bars separating you from a corridor beyond.
        In the corner huddles another prisoner, his face partially obscured by shadows.
        He shivers nervously, his eyes darting around the room, as if he expects something to happen...

        A massive door of reinforced metal locks the exit tightly.
        It glows dimly with the light of its adorned runes.

        Through the bars, you can see the figure of a sentinel standing guard.
        Its full-body metallic armor makes it impossible to tell if it's even human.
        The sentinel's head scans the area with an unwavering gaze,
        ensuring that escape is not an option.

                Your kind wielded forces most could barely comprehend, but now it's all gone...
                Your abilities... They served no purpose but deceit...
